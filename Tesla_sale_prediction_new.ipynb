    "The dataset for Tesla's sales analysis contains key information about the company's \"Total automotive revenues\" over various quarters. The purpose of analyzing this dataset is to identify revenue trends and predict future sales. This is achieved through a sequence of data preparation and predictive modeling steps, including:\n",
    "    1. Data Extraction: The relevant row for \"Total automotive revenues\" is extracted and transposed for analysis. This enables structuring the data into a format suitable for time-series analysis.\n",
    "    2. Data Cleaning and Transformation: The revenue data is cleaned to remove formatting issues and converted to numeric format. Only rows adhering to a specific quarterly format (Q1, Q2, Q3-2023) are retained, ensuring accuracy in temporal alignment.\n",
    "    3. Feature Engineering: Additional features such as year, quarter number, and lagged revenue (previous quarter's revenue) are created. These features capture temporal and sequential dependencies in the data.\n",
    "    4. Predictive Modeling: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. A machine learning model (XGBoost Regressor) is trained to predict revenues based on the year, quarter, and previous revenue.\n",
    "    5. Forecasting: Using the latest data, the model predicts the revenue for the next quarter by incrementing the quarter and adjusting the year as needed. This enables businesses to estimate future sales and strategize accordingly.\n"
